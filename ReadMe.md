## Data Organization: A tutorial

<http://stephenturner.github.io/dataorganization>

This is a tutorial on organizing data in spreadsheets, forked from [kbroman/dataorg](https://github.com/kbroman/dataorg).

To compile the files, you'll need the [R/broman](https://github.com/kbroman/broman) package; install it with `devtools::install_github("kbroman/broman")`. (I use the [`excel_fig()`](https://github.com/kbroman/broman/blob/master/R/excel_fig.R) function, which is not yet in the version of R/broman that's on CRAN.)
