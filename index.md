My collaborators sometimes ask me, "In what form would you like the data?"
My response is always, "In its current form!" If the data need to be
reformatted, it's much better for me to write a script than
for them to do a bunch of cut-and-paste. I'm a strong proponent of
data analysts being able to handle any data files they might
receive.

But in many cases, I have to spend **a lot** of time writing scripts
to rearrange the layout of the data. And how would you like your data
analysts to spend their time? Reorganizing data, or really analyzing
data?

Most of my collaborators enter and store their data in spreadsheets,
and mostly Microsoft Excel. Before starting to enter data into a
spreadsheet, it's good to spend some time thinking about the
layout. The way that you organize the data in spreadsheets can have a
big impact on your data analyst's quality of life.

This is a tutorial on that topic: *how to organize data in
spreadsheets*. For complex, high-dimensional data, it may be better to
use a formal database. But for many projects, spreadsheets are
perfectly fine. But data in spreadsheets can be pretty and easy to
work with, or they can be a sloppy mess requiring serious
downstream reorganization efforts. We want to avoid the latter.

I don't think these ideas comes naturally to anyone.
So if you're not happy with the
structure of your current data files, don't despair! But try to
organize your next data set in a way that will make analyses easier.
